					<p>Climate change continues to be a discussion with arguments that are both for or against its legitimacy. Regardless of any personal preferences, 
						there are enough data and information to support the idea that a warmer and more disaster-ridden climate is in our future.  Our job is to provide 
						tools and techniques to further the investigation as well as help settle the debate in hopes of being more prepared for what comes next.  For more
						information, you can view this  <a href="https://prezi.com/view/DKGDQOAv2woV6YgKKx6r" class="external" target="_blank">presentation</a>.
